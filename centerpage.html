            <img src="img3.webp" height="200px" width="200px">
            <p>Ikigai can describe having a sense of purpose in life, as well as being motivated. According to a study by Michiko Kumano, feeling ikigai as described in Japanese usually means the feeling of accomplishment and fulfillment that follows when people pursue their passions. Activities that generate the feeling of ikigai are not forced on an individual; they are perceived as being spontaneous and undertaken willingly, and thus are personal and depend on a person's inner self.

                According to psychologist Katsuya Inoue, ikigai is a concept consisting of two aspects: "sources or objects that bring value or meaning to life" and "a feeling that one's life has value or meaning because of the existence of its source or object". Inoue classifies ikigai into three directions – social ikigai, non-social ikigai, and anti-social ikigai – from a social perspective. Social ikigai refers to ikigai that are accepted by society through volunteer activities and circle activities. An asocial ikigai is an ikigai that is not directly related to society, such as faith or self-discipline. Anti-social ikigai refers to ikigai, which is the basic motivation for living through dark emotions, such as the desire to hate someone or something or to continue having a desire for revenge. </p>

        <h1><u>8.Gitanjli</u></h1>
        <img src="img8.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
        <p>Translated by Tagore himself, the book is a collection of translated poems from the original Bengali version of Gitanjali.

            An integration of two words, 'Git' and 'Anjali,' meaning song and offering respectively, the literal meaning of the word is 'offering of songs.' Gitanjali was inspired by medieval Indian lyrics of devotion in which the principal subjects is love, though some poems detail the internal conflict between spiritual longings and earthly desires.
            
            Each poem gives readers an essence of the various elements of Mother Nature and makes one feel connected to nature while reading them. It highlights the poet's intense response to the magnificence of the universe or rather an affirmation of life with all its abundance, mystery and diversity.
            
            Tagore received the Nobel Prize for Literature, largely for the English translation, Song Offerings. It is part of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.</p>

         <h1><u>10.It Start With You</u></h1>
         <img src="img10.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
        <p> I lived every emotion both Atlas and Lily were going through while reading.
        Each scenario, each line, each emotion hits you hard. 
        
        I felt love a lot while reading.
        I laughed a lot while reading.
        I smiled a lot while reading.
        
        Theo was such an incredible character. I was intrigued everytime Atlas was having a conversation with Theo. I laughed so hard everytime he made up some cheesy line to tease Atlas.
        
        I really appreciated Lily's character and strength in it ends with us too, just as much I appreciated her for the same in It starts with us. She really is an inspiring female mc.
        
        Josh, Emerson, Rylee, Allysa, Marshall, Lily's mother, and all the other characters made me fall for them even more everytime. 
        The book kept me hooked from the beginning and I binged read it in 1.5 days. 
        
        I believe each of us deserves an Atlas Corrigan in our lives.
        I am gonna re-read the book, and I am sure I'll read it over and over without getting bored.
        Every part of me loved the book. 🤍</p>
